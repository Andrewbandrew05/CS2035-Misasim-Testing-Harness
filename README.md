# CS2035-Misasim-Testing-Harness
Testing harness for 2035 project 1 (fall 2024)
How to use:
1. Set display resolution to 1920x1080p
2. Set display scaling to 100% (NOTE: you may have to manually restart your computer after doing this)
3. Open misasim, load your .asm file, maximize the window, and move it to the first slot in the taskbar
4. run misasim clicker and follow its prompts!

Extra Notes:
I'd suggest closing out of misasim between runs to close all the random tabs the program opens
At the top of the misasim clicker python file is a variable called bufferbase. Try increasing this if the program frequently crashes (everything has to be done by just waiting for things to complete so if your computer isn't quite as fast as mine it might not work without a bit of finangling)
